Welcome to the **Speed Typing Game**, a web-based application designed to test and improve your typing speed in a fun and interactive way. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game challenges players to type out given paragraphs within a set time limit while tracking speed (words per minute), accuracy, and mistakes.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start typing the displayed paragraph in the input field as accurately and quickly as possible.
2. Keep an eye on the timer, your typing speed (WPM), and your accuracy (CPM) as you type.
3. Once the time is up or the paragraph is completed, your final speed, accuracy, and the number of mistakes will be displayed.
4. Click the "Try Again" button to reset the game and try a different paragraph.

## 🌟 Features

- **Paragraphs for Typing**: Randomly selected paragraphs for each game session to keep the challenge fresh.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on typing speed (WPM), accuracy (CPM), and mistakes.
- **Countdown Timer**: A 60-second timer to add urgency and challenge to the game.
- **Try Again Button**: Easily reset the game to start a new typing challenge.
